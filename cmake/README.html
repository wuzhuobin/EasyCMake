<h1>Components</h1>
<p>--Providing loose coupling ways to extend EasyCMake functions. 
    Just doing simple copy and paste files can add new dependency to the CMake build projects
</p>
<h2>SubDirectory</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Subdirectory.cmake</h4>
    This module is used in build hierarchical cmake project. It will be include in the
    beginning of CMakeList.txt. It should be made of only <code>add_subdirectory(...)</code>.
    Adding all sub modules by adding a new line of <code>add_subdirectory(...)</code> inside.
    e.g.
    <code>
      add_subdirectory(QvtkUtil)<br/>
      add_subdirectory(Filter)<br/>
      add_subdirectory(Widget)<br/>
    </code>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Find Modules</h2>
These modules would be mainly used for finding dependency and linking library. 
They are included in the CMakeLists.txt before creation of the default CMake's targets.
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4>FindCTK.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding CTK and link its library.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindITK.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding ITK and link its library.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindQtCoreQtWidget.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding Qt5Core and Qt5Widget and link its library. The AUTOMOC 
      function of cmake will be enabled, the cmake will automatically find and moc. All *.ui files 
      of qt will be wrapped to generate qt's ui header. All *.qrc files of qt will be wrapped to
      generate qt resource source file.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindQtOpenGl.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding Qt5OpenGl and link its library. And FindQtCoreQtWidget is the 
      prerequisite.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindQtPrintSupport.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding Qt5PrintSupport and link its library. And FindQtCoreQtWidget is the 
      prerequisite.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindQtSql.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding Qt5Sql and link its library. And FindQtCoreQtWidget is the 
      prerequisite.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindQtXml.cmake </h4>
      This module is used for finding Qt5Xml and link its library. And FindQtCoreQtWidget is the 
      prerequisite.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindQtConcurrent.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding Qt5Concurrent and link its library. And FindQtCoreQtWidget is the 
      prerequisite.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>FindVTK.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for finding VTK and its library.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>Target Modules</h2>
These moudles would be mainly used for creating a new target whether it dependens on others. 
Thery are included in he CMakeLists.txt after the creation of the default CMake's targets.
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4>TargetConfigureFile.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for configurating cmake's configure file when doing exporting. This is 
      usually needed with TargetInstall.cmake
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>TargetDoxygen.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for creating a new target using doxygen to build documentation while 
      Doxyfile.in must be provided. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>TargetInstall.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for configurating cmake install target. The install target could export 
      cmake configuration, shared libraries, static libraries and header files, which is needed to 
      re-use this cmake package. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>TargetOtherResource.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for creating a new target which it copys some necessary resources (such as 
      some STLs, some example images..) to the folder where exectuables are placed. The PATH set in 
      <code>PROJECT_RESOURCE</code> must be a folder path. So it can be copied recursively. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>TargetQtLinguistTools.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for creating a new target which handles qt's *.ts files (Qt translation). This
      target will try to find QtLinguistTools. The module could generate correct *.qm file for the exectuable
      and copy it to the executable path.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>TargetQtTest.cmake</h4>
      This module is used for creating a new target about doing qtest and ctest. It will scan through the path
      <code>${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR>/Testing/*.c*</code> and create exectuable for each file. Each executable will 
      be added to ctest as well. Each *.c* file is suggested to written in qtest format but it is not
      compulsory. Since qtest need qobject, this target will append Qt5Core dependency.
    </li>
  </ol>
